* Reason:       To support automatic insertion of revision, module name etc. by the source 
*               revision control system it is necessary to violate the rule, because the 
*               system uses non basic characters as placeholders.
* Verification: The placeholders are used in commentars only. Therefore rule violation cannot 
*               influency code compilation.
